## Tasks

### 0. [It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](./0-whatsmyname.c) : A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
	- If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again.
	- You should not remove the path before the name of the program.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-whatsmyname.c -o mynameis`
### 1. [Silence is argument carried out by other means](./1-args.c) : A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
	- Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-args.c -o nargs`
### 2. [The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter](./2-args.c) : A program that prints all the arguments it receives.
	- All arguments should be printed, including the first one.
	- Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 2-args.c -o args`
### 3. [Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument](./3-mul.c) : A program that multiplies two numbers.
	- Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line.
	- You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer.
	- If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-mul.c -o mul`
### 4. [To infinity and beyond](./4-add.c) : A program that adds positive numbers.
	- Print the result, followed by a new line.
	- If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line.
	- If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`.
	- You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an `int`.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 4-add.c -o add`
### 5. [Minimal Number of Coins for Change](./100-change.c) : A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
	- Usage: `./change cents`
	- Where `cents` is the amount of cents you need to give back.
	- if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly `1`, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`.
	- You should use `atoi` to parse the parameter passed to your program.
	- If the number passed as the argument is negative, print `0`, followed by a new line.
	- You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent.
	- Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-change.c -o change`
