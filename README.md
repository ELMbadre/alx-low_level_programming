# This repository contains `alx` C projects and other low level programming exercices.

# Low-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **Low-level programming** and **algorithm**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX Software Engineering School](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## Technologies

* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
