## General:

An introductory project on:

- Arithmetic operators and how to use them
- Logical operators (boolean operators) and how to use them
- Relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- How to declare variables
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to print the values of variables with printf
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- What is the ASCII character set
- The purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

### Tasks:

#### Mandatory Tasks:

* 0-positive_or_negative.c: Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

Print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
The output of the program should be: - The number, followed by - if the number is greater than 0: is positive - if the number is 0: is zero - if the number is less than 0: is negative - followed by a new line
* 1-last_digit.c: Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

Print whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable n is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.
The output of the program should be: - The string Last digit of, followed by - n, followed by - the string 'is', followed by - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5 - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0 - followed by a new line
* 2-print_alphabet.c: Print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

* 3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

* 4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except the letters q and e using putchar.

* 5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

* 6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

* 7-print_tebahpla.c - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using putchar.

* 8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using putchar.

* 9-print_comb.c - prints all single-digit numbers, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

### Advanced Tasks:

* 100-print_comb3.c - prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

* 101-print_comb4.c - prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.

* 102-print_comb5.c - prints all possible different combinations of two two digit numbers, separated by a comma, using putchar, without using a variable of type char.
